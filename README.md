## General info
NFT on Cardano only started in 10th March, as cardanokidz test nft is the first on the cardano blockchain and it was minted on the 10th March 2021. This shows how new the industry is in Cardano and how we can be an early adopter in this industry. Marketplace for NFT on Cardano is expected around Q3 of 2021 when smart contracts roll out. By then, I hope that this project can gain some traction. Currently, the only few “marketplaces” are discord channel CNFT.io and twitter. This lack of exposure and the huge potential for growth is something that we should not miss.
